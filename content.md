# Technical Interview Prep

The technical interview is a measure of your understanding of object-oriented programming, coachability, communication, debugging, error handling, and proficiency with tools like VSCode and the terminal. During the interview, you will be given a technical question and have approximately 20 minutes to work through it. 

### Preparing for the Technical Interview

Here are key aspects to focus on:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Understanding the core principles such as encapsulation, methods, and data types.
- **Debugging and Error Handling**: Be prepared to identify and fix errors as they arise.
- **Tool Proficiency**: Familiarize yourself with tools like VSCode and the terminal.
- **Communication**: Be prepared to communicate your thought process as you work through the exercises.

It can be nerve-wracking to code while someone observes you. To combat this, practice extensively!

## Sample Technical Interview

You can use the following repository to simulate a technical interview:

[Sample Technical Interview GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DPI-WE/sample-technical-interview)

### Steps to Practice:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Open it in a GitHub codespace or locally.
3. Time yourself for 20 minutes to solve the problem.
4. Familiarize yourself with commands like:
   - `ruby app.rb` (or specific file names like `birthday_cake.rb`)
   - Terminal commands: `ls`, `cd`, etc.
5. Read error messages carefully and debug step by step.
6. Talk through your thought process aloud. If you feel awkward, talk to a rubber duck, your cat, or even your dog!

### Ask for Help

Remember, you are encouraged to ask questions during the interview. We operate under a "lock before key" principle, which means:
- You must ask a question to unlock the solution (key).
- We may guide you but won’t always directly provide the answer unless you engage with us!

### Resources for Practice

- Book time with a TA for additional practice questions.
- Explore [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby) for Ruby exercises.
